hello this an text file....
to test my understanding on git and gitHub

git:
git is an vesion control software
were group of people can work on a same project and same given time
this software can track all the changes made to the project.

gitHub:
is an code housting online portal which uses git
it is an online tool for version controle and collaberate with other to work on same project at same time
--here each "repository" represents an a project
--branches-here branches are used to divert from master branch and make any changes to the present project and commit it and pysh and merge it with master branch
--commit-here is nothing but save the changes made
--push-push comand is uesed to push the local branch to the remote server(here in case gitHub) 
--then we use GUI interfase of githud and pull and marge the brach changes to the remote repo
--sync or pull-then to sync with the remote repo we pull it into local repo with the help of git pull
